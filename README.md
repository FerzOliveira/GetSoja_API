# GetSoja_API
A basic API project that scraps the prices of soy of brazilian market from the website www.canalrural.com.br/cotacao/soja

It needs a database to put the data somewhere, i will not provide it her, but feel free to create one by yourself.<br>
ItÂ´s pretty simple but in future i plan to do a little documentation to make easier for comprehending.
